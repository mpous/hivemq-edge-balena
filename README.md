# HiveMQ Edge running on balena

This is an industrial edge reference architecture running HiveMQ Edge with an embedded MQTT broker and an Edge UI to connect the edge device with PLCs and others. This IIoT edge gateway is running on a balena.

You can read more information on the [HiveMQ Edge repository](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-edge).
